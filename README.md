# 2018 FRC Code

# Project Title
When creating a project, please include the title of the project that the code is running and the date created. 

# Getting Started
Under the libraries at the beginning of the code, you need to post the functions of the code. These functions include:

* what part(s) of the code work

* what part(s) of the code do not work

* what part(s) of the code is untested

* what part(s) of the code are completed

In Java, there are two ways to write comments:

* To write code for a single line, write // text

* To write code for multiple lines, write /* text */ 

Here is an example of what your code should look like:

// Functions:

/*
 * What works:
 * Drivetrain
 * Shooter
 * Lift
 * Agitator

 */


# Tips for being successful

Make sure that you save and deploy your code regularly! One error can make all the difference. 

Provide comments next to lines of code, especially when you change numbers or variables. This will help you keep a record of what you have sed. 

IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK! You can ask Ben, Em, or Lon as all three of them know programming and are willing to help.
